# dogbreed-app
Here is the description in a nutshell of this dogbreed-app.

--What this dogbreed-app attempt is to display most of dog breeds and users can search a particular dog breed and see some photos of dogs. For dog lovers, it's a nice place to search and watch all lovely pictures in one place.

--The technologies that I use for this project include Spring Boot framework, Java, Web MVC, JPA, in-memory H2 database, JsonConverter, Thymeleaf, Javascript, Jquery, ajax, html, css.

--This app uses the public DOG API (https://dog.ceo/dog-api/) to pull in all the breed information and images.
	Here is how to check out and run the app in your own local environment:

	git clone https://github.com/slee654/dogbreed-app.git
	cd dogbreed-app
	mvn spring-boot:run
	from your browser: localhost:8080/dogs
